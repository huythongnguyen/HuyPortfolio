- Owned technical objectives for K&I and Geo-level OKRs to improve Rich Visual Offering metric, making Maps more visual by associating more photos/videos to topics about places
- Drove cross-org adoption—became go-to embedding solution for 4+ major downstream launches:
  - *Google Maps*: Rich Visual Offering exceeding OKRs by 25%, precision +20%, photo coverage +30%, video coverage +50%, engagement +3%
  - *Google Search*: Photo/video/merchant post retrieval and ranking for local queries (+0.35 cSUNs)
  - *Place Answers & Magi Q&A*: Photo retrieval for local place questions (3× coverage improvement)
  - *YouTube Local Shorts*: Automated Shorts generation for local places
- Directed multi-year $3M+ human-annotation budget for text-image-video relevancy
- Developed LLM-labeling pipelines to annotate 1B+ images/videos, saving +$10M in annotation costs and eliminating 6-month data bottleneck—accelerating model iteration cycles
- Invented multi-teacher learning algorithms, resulting in 2 publications and 4 patents—advancing the state of knowledge distillation

### Automated Business Intelligence

Built multi-task systems extracting business attributes from Street View imagery, driving global data freshness

- Enabled fully automated POI launches in 10+ new countries, increasing automation rate from 4% to 50%—accelerating Google Maps expansion into emerging markets
- Launched first fully automated POI extraction (phone numbers) in India, establishing production blueprint for global rollout and reducing dependency on manual operations

### Led Geo-Specific Language Model Pretraining

- Pretrained internal Geo-specific language models (Geo-MUM), delivering 2–5% accuracy lift across knowledge-understanding tasks—improving how Google understands location-based queries

### Mentored Engineers & Drove IP Strategy

- Coached 3 engineers to promotion (2 Junior → Mid, 1 Mid → Senior), building a culture of growth and technical excellence
- Advised intern on research published at ECCV 2022, fostering research excellence
- Authored 6 patents, protecting Google's competitive advantage in multimodal AI

### Awarded

- *Geo Tech Award 2024-H1*: Rich Visual Offerings Data—Fused Topics and Beehive Image Matcher
- *Geo Tech Award 2022-H2*: BizView Full Automation
